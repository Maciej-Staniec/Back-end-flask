# Portfo-Flask-Server
A very basic flask server hosted on the pythonanywhere.com domain name.
It accepts dynamic URL parameters.
When submitting a contact form, it creates a CSV file with the email, subject and message headers.
If the directory and/or file doesn't exist, it gets created.

It is one of the projects I found interesting in the ZTM course that I took on the Udemy platform.
